### About Single-Cell RNA Sequencing
Single Cell RNA sequencing is a very on-going technology adapted by various fields in Biology

### Reference : [Introduction to single-cell RNA-seq](https://hbctraining.github.io/scRNA-seq_online/lessons/01_intro_to_scRNA-seq.html)
This exciting and cutting-edge method can be used to:

explore which cell types are present in a tissue
identify unknown/rare cell types or states
elucidate the changes in gene expression during differentiation processes or across time or states
identify genes that are differentially expressed in particular cell types between conditions (e.g. treatment or disease)
explore changes in expression among a cell type while incorporating spatial, regulatory, and/or protein information
