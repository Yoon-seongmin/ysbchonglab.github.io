* Systematic Lupus Erythmatosus
* Atopic Dermatitis
* Psoriasis
* Ankylosing Spondylitis
* Juvenille Dermatomyositis

Autoimmune diseases are systemic disease that affects whole body. They are complicated to understand and phenotypes varies person to person. Recently developed technology of single-cell sequencing can be used to elucidate these Autoimmune diseases more deeply.  

Heterogeneous Phenotypes and Clinical Information can be stratified and be analyzed integratively by Single-cell RNAseq as seen [below](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41590-020-0743-0)

* Lung Cancer
* Pancreatic Cancer  

Cancers are very heterogeneous and studies are on-going about Tumor MicroEnvironments(TME) and Interactions with other immune/non-immune cell types are still more to find.  

Comprehensive Analyses of Tumor-specific cell types and its effects in TME are of concern
